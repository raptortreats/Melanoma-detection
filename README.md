# Melanoma Detection
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

## Conclusions
-After using augmentor library accuracy on training has been increased.
-Model can be improved by tuning the hyperparameter.
-Model might be still overfitting but adding more layers might clear that.


## Technologies Used
- Tensorflow
- matplotlib
- pandas
